3. UseEffect
4. UseLayoutEffect
5. UseReducer
6. UseContext

// for UseMemo & UseCallback - both are used for optimising the code so that big computations don't rrun on every sideeffect or everytime
// they only run on specific conditions.
// UseMemo access the value
// UseCallback access the function
